    "The text in [code cells](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#code-cell) can be quickly changed like a regular textbox. In order to change the content of a [markdown cell](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#markdown-cell), you need to expose the markdown content underneath by double-clicking the [cell](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#cell). This will reveal the plain text of the markdown that creates various elements like headings, links, images, etc. When you want the cell to render again, you can simply run it again by pushing the play button or pressing Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or shift + return (OS X) on your keyboard."

In terms of styling, markdown is very minimalist. If you would like to include an element that is not included in markdown in your notebook, you can also use HTML and CSS in your [markdown cells](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#markdown-cell)."

# Project 2

## Name

## Class year

## Complete the Assigned Perusall reading. Then look at the Universal Dependencies ATIS page: https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/en_atis/index.html. Who is acknowledged as contributing to this dataset (and its annotations)? Who is not? Why? (Hint: compare that ATIS page to this one: https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/en_gumreddit/index.html.)

## Project Description

The goals of this assignment are:
* To introduce you to some basic NLP tasks: tasks that operate over characters and words.
* To introduce you to some of the ways NLP has been done over time, and how NLP illustrates the historical development of AI.

Here are the steps you should do to successfully complete this project:
1. From moodle, accept the assignment.
2. Open and set up a code space (install a python kernal and select it).
3. Complete the notebook and commit it to Github. Make sure to answer all questions, and to commit the notebook in a "run" state!
4. Edit the README.md file. Provide your name, your class year and what you hope to get out of this course. Make sure to include the output from running second_nlp.py!
5. Commit your code often. We will take the last commit before the deadline as your submission of the project.

For extra credit:
* Read the spaCy docs (https://spacy.io/usage/models). Figure out how to make spaCy work for another language. Add a mercury drop down menu (https://runmercury.com/docs/input-widgets/select/) for choosing a language. Include a screenshot of your modified web app running.
* Read the spaCy docs for token-based matching (https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching). Write a rule matcher for recognizing models of iPhone (iPhone, iphone, iPhone 6, etc). 
* ChatGPT vs spaCy! Pick a text, and run it through spaCy to get the tokens, lemmas, parts of speech and named entities. Then ask ChatGPT to give you the tokens, lemmas, parts of speech and named entities for the same text. Make a table listing the output from spaCy, the output from ChatGPT, and your analysis of each output.
* Your other ideas are welcome! If you'd like to discuss one with Dr Stent, feel free.

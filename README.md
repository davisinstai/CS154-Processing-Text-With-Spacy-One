## Project Description
The goals of this assignment are:
* To introduce you to tools commonly used by software developers and data scientists: Git and Github, Codespaces, and Jupyter notebooks.
* To introduce you to doing NLP with python and documenting what you do with markdown.

Here are the steps you should do to successfully complete this project:
1. From the repository homepage, make a new codespace.
2. Complete this notebook and commit it to Github. Make sure to answer all questions, and to commit the notebook in a "run" state!
3. Edit the README.md file. Provide your name, your class year and what you hope to get out of this course. Make sure to include the output from running first_nlp.py!
4. Commit your code.
5. Open a pull request and let the course personnel know that youâ€™ve finished this assignment.

For extra credit:
* Create your profile README. Let the world know a little bit more about you! What are you interested in learning? What are you working on? What's your favorite hobby? Learn more about creating your profile README in the document, ["Managing Your Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme). Make sure to tell us in your readme that you've done this extension, and to give us the link to your profile!
* Go to your user dashboard and create a new repository. Experiment with the features within that repository to familiarize yourself with them.  Make sure to tell us in your readme that you've done this extension, and to give us the link to the repository!
